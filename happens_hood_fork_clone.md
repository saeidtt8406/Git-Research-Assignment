What happens "Under the Hood"?
Forking: GitHub creates a server-side link between the original repository and your new copy. It copies the entire history and all branches to your account.

Cloning: Git downloads the entire repository database (the .git folder), including every version of every file in the project's history, and "checks out" the latest version of the files into your working directory.
