he difference between Pull, Pull Request (PR), and Push:
Push: Sending your local committed changes to a remote server (like GitHub).

Pull: Bringing changes from a remote server down to your local machine.

Pull Request: A formal request or "proposal" on GitHub to merge a set of changes from one branch (or fork) into another. It is a collaboration feature, not a Git command.
